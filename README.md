# Developing-command-prompt-application-using-Oracle-DB-MySQL-Python-Eclipse-and-Java

Database Platform- Oracle Sqldeveloper 
Application Platform- Eclipse IDE
For the Project we have combined several statements and clauses which are listed above and designed our query to get the required output.

MVC- MODEL VIEW CONTROLLER
Files created to implement command-prompt application are: 
Movie.java - Explains creating  Models that can organize and represent data in database application
Moviecontroller.java – we created connection and controls to get data from database 
MovieView.java – has views to present data
MovieDb.java – MovieController  main class has 7 functions and when we call 7 functions an object is created for MovieController

Used Python 3.6.4 to remove null values while converting files in tsv to csv format
